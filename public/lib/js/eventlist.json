      "DescriptionEvent": "Chris uses classic songs from artists such as Bob Dylan, Hank Williams, The Beatles, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, John Denver, Carol King, Neil Young, Jimmy Buffet, Gordon Lightfoot, etc. to teach basic guitar skills that build on each other as you progress into a well rounded guitar player. These skills include: basic chords, bass riffs, fingerstyle, moveable chord forms, melodic scales and ocassional alternate tunings. Transferring these skills on your own to any song you may learn later is also emphasized. Plenty of insights are also offered like how to hang on to that pick and how to get rid of that buzz or clunky sound on a string. Join us as Chris pays tribute to the music of John Prine."

      "DescriptionEvent": "Elev8tor is combination of electronic music programming, live drums inspired by the funky drum breaks of the 60's and 70's, and the dreaminess of downtempo with a dance club delivery. Started initially as a live performance vehicle for keyboardist Kevin Ford's collection of original downtempo tracks, Elev8tor has grown in its members, styles, and influences. After a history of numerous (separate and collective) studio collaborations between Sam Sharp (drummer), Olin Langley (bass), Bryan Ford (guitar), and Kevin Ford, singer Darcy Markham joined the formula and the band began pursuing an energized club sound. Collective roots in the underground loft party culture in Chicago and a series of club performances gave the group its 'peak hour' ambitions. After producing their debut self-titled album, Elev8tor, the band transformed once again, introducing Vanessa Vincent as their new lead singer. With this change came a new set of material prompting the next evolution in Elev8tor’s unique style."
